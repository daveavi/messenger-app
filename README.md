# Express Starter

This starter repo will be used for building applications using React, Material-UI, React-Router, Node, & Express.js.

## Getting started

Run the server (see Readme in that folder). Make sure to have MongoDB installed and running locally on your computer.

`npm install`
`npm run dev`

Run the client (see Readme in that folder).

`npm install`
`npm start`

Access the client at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and it will talk to the server (using a proxy to [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)).
